# What is ProGAN

ProGAN, short for Progressive Growing of GANs, is a deep learning architecture known for its ability to generate high-resolution. Developed by researchers at NVIDIA, ProGAN has revolutionized the field of generative adversarial networks (GANs) by introducing a progressive training approach. Unlike traditional GANs, ProGAN starts with low-resolution images and progressively increases the resolution during training, resulting in sharper and more detailed output. This incremental refinement allows ProGAN to generate images with unprecedented realism and fidelity, making it a cornerstone in the realm of computer vision and artificial intelligence. With its innovative techniques and remarkable results, ProGAN continues to inspire advancements in image synthesis and generation tasks across various domains.

## This Project

This project is intended for educational purposes. ProGAN was used to generate clothes based on H&M dataset. This project was written using PyTorch framework. 
WGAN with GP, minibatch std, pixelwise normalization were used similar to the original paper. Unlike the original paper, the project was tested using FID (Frechet Inception Distance) metric.
It achieved a final score of approximately 95.4 for 1024 real images and 1024 generated images.
